## Who we are
- We are a team of data scientists working on a project with the goal of identifying opportunities for customer sustainability;
- Considering the database, values, and products, as well as the services within the OLIST ecosystem;
- Following this preliminary analysis, we have arrived at a potential OLIST persona

## Main persona's problem
- Lacks visibility into revenue forecasts and demand (frequently runs out of stock)
- Lack of support in marketing and sales, operations, and finance
- Lack of capital to invest in improvements to increase revenue, delivery reach, new customers and earnings. Need to amplify the importance of customer loyalty.

## Job to be done
- Every order is important.
- Positive purchasing experiences ensure sustainability in revenue generation.

## Some insights
1 - The majority of purchases made on Olist are of low value.
2 - It's likely that the profile of sellers is that of small business owners.
3 - Between 2017 and 2018, the majority of sellers would be classified as MEI.

## How we are going to offer a solution?
Analysis of ratings and reviews. 

- Was any purchase from the same seller made by the same buyer after a negative review?

# How might we?
- How can we help 'Fabinho' improve the repeat purchase rate of his customers?
